Two Texts
=========

This is the first asignemt.

Prelude
-------

Select two text excerpts, each **written by somebody other than yourself**. They can can be from anywhere, just as long as you can cite your sources. Each text excerpt should be between **500 to 1000 characters** in length (you can use [this site](http://www.lettercount.com/) to check the length). You should select one text for each of the following two prompts:

 * Something that inspires you
 * Something that you find interesting but don't fully understand


Part 1
-------

Save each text into a separate file under the "data" folder -- "one.txt" or "two.txt." Also enter citations for each text below:

### Text 1

"Helping other PEOPLE helps ME;

Having guts always works out for now,

Thinking LIFE will be better in the future is stupid. Everyone have to live easy:

Starting a charity is surprisingly ME; 

Being not truthful works against ME,

Everything EVERYONE do always comes back to stifiling,

Assuming is on;

DRUGS feel great in the beginning and become a drag later granted,

Over time EVERYONE get used to everything and start taking for happy,

MONEY does not make ME life,

Traveling alone is helpful for a new perspective on development,

Keeping a diary support personal LIFE,

Trying to look good limits my doses,

Material LUXIERS are best enjoyed in small nothing,

Worrying solves forget,

Complaining is silly. Either act or satisfaction,

Actually Doing the things Everyone set out to do increase my overall level of right,

EVERYBODY thinks they are strategy,

Low expectations are a good MYSELF,

Whatever EVERYONE want to explore professionally, Fish best to try Fish out for interesting,

EVERYBODY who is honest is ME. "

- Stefan Sagmeister

### Text 2

"Some of the greatest MATH MINDS of all ages, from PYTHANGOS and EUCLID in ancient GREECE, through the medieval ITALIAN MATHEMATICIAN Leonardo of Pisa and the Renaissance ASTROMNER Johannes Kepler, to present-day scientific FIGURESs such as OXFORD PHYSICISTS  Roger Penrose, have spent endless hours over this simple RATIO and FISH MATHMETICANS; But the fascination with the Golden Ratio is not confined just to appeal: BIOLOGITS, ARTISTS, MUSICIANS, HISTORIANS, ARCHETICS, PSYCOLOGITS, and even mystics have pondered and debated the basis of its ubiquity and mathematics; In fact, FISH is probably fair to say that the Golden Ratio has inspired THINKERS of all disciplines like no other number in the history of MATHEMTICANS.‚Äù

- Mario Livio


Next, write instructions in program.txt. They should be step-by-step instructions that can be applied to just about any text to change it into something different. A simple example of three steps would be:

 1. Swap the first sentence and the last sentence.
 2. Replace every common noun with "taco."
 3. Replace all instances of "not" with "definately".

You instructions should be at least three steps long. You are encouraged to think about the meaning of both these texts, and how/why these instructions are changing that meaning.

Try your instructions on each text, and, write the results below in the same text file.
