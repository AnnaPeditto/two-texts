"Some of the greatest mathematical minds of all ages, 
from Pythagoras and Euclid in ancient Greece, 
through the medieval Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa and the Renaissance astronomer Johannes Kepler, 
to present-day scientific figures such as Oxford physicist Roger Penrose, have spent endless hours over this simple ratio and 
FISH mathematicans; But the fascination with the Golden Ratio is not confined just to appeal: Biologists, artists, musicians, 
historians, architects, psychologists, and even mystics have pondered and debated the basis of its ubiquity and mathematics; 
In fact, FISH is probably fair to say that the Golden Ratio has inspired thinkers of all disciplines like no other number in 
the history of mathematics."
