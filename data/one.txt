"Helping other people helps me;

Having guts always works out for now,

Thinking life will be better in the future is stupid. Everyone have to live easy:

Starting a charity is surprisingly me; 

Being not truthful works against me,

Everything Everyone do always comes back to stifiling,

Assuming is on;

Drugs feel great in the beginning and become a drag later granted,

Over time Everyone get used to everything and start taking for happy,

Money does not make me life,

Traveling alone is helpful for a new perspective on development,

Keeping a diary support personal life,

Trying to look good limits my doses,

Material luxuries are best enjoyed in small nothing,

Worrying solves forget,

Complaining is silly. Either act or satisfaction,

Actually Doing the things Everyone set out to do increase my overall level of right,

Everybody thinks they are strategy,

Low expectations are a good myself,

Whatever Everyone want to explore professionally, Fish best to try Fish out for interesting,

Everybody who is honest is me. "
