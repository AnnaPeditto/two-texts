"Helping other people helps me.

Having guts always works out for me.

Thinking life will be better int eh future is stupid. I have to live now.

Starting a charity is surprisingly easy. 

Being not truthful works against me.

Everything I do always comes back to me.

Assuming is Stifling.

Drugs feel great int eh beginning and become a drag later on.

Over time I get used to everything and start taking for granted.

Money does not make me happy

Traveling alone is helpful for a new perspective on life.

Keeping a diary support personal development.

Trying to look good limits my life.

Material luxuries are best enjoyed in small doses. 

Worrying solves nothing.

Complaining is silly. Either act or forget.

Actually Doing the things i set out to do increase my overall level of satisfaction.

Everybody thinks they are right.

Low expectations are a good strategy.

Whatever I want to explore professionally, its best to try it out for myself.

Everybody who is honest is interesting. "
